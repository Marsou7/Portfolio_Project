Description/Intro
    This Movie Studio Project was created to track the Movie bussniess in different aspects. 
For example, how much does a certin actor cost or how much did a moive make last year. As i was creating this 
database i noticed that i was also making a type of "IMDB" database. I tried to be diffrent from that idea, i 
wanted something slighly diffrent. I wanted to see how a Moive studio does business works and how many differnt 
moving parts are in it.

Q & A
    How did the Project's design evolve over time?
It was very basic at first. I didnt know what i was doing or what i wanted to do as a project. as time went on 
i found myself wanted to add more and be able to retrive more data from the database. The Project chllenged me,
in the end i like the idea i went with.

    Did you choose to use ORM or raw SQL? Why?
I chose to go with raw SQL, i wanted to practive my SQL and focus on SQL.

    What future improements are in store, if any?
I would like to add a way to be able to seach by picture of someone you may think is an actor or acctress. 
Adding a comments table for people to post would be cool too.
